prattle(1) -- Precedence parser
===============================

## SYNOPSIS

`prattle` <input_string>

## DESCRIPTION

**Prattle** is a simple and hacky attempt at a Pratt-style precedence parser. It takes the input supplied on the command line, tokenises it, and parses it into an expression tree using precedence climbing/Pratt parsing.

It's mainly an excuse for me to mess around with parsing techniques.
